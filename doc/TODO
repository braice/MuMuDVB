 * support for IPv6

 * Http unicast
  * Master connection not mandatory, option unicast=1

  * make the syntax autoconfiguration=1/2 obsolete and replace by full/partial
  * In partial autoconfiguration, add a step for channels with a service ID and no PMT (this step will be skipped in full autoconf since we get both automatically)
