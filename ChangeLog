-- MuMuDVB 1.6 --

New features / improvements : 
 * Support for HTTP Unicast
 * Implementation of the RTP headers.
 * The limit in the size of the PAT PID for PAT rewriting has been removed
 * PAT rewrite is less CPU consuming
 * ATSC autoconfiguration fully fonctionnal
 * Autoconfiguration: MuMuDVB can update the PIDs while running if they change
 * Tuning: Support for circular polarization, more LNBs and possibility to fix LNB voltage to 0V
 * Tuning: We can set the coderate (FEC) for satellite and cable with the option coderate
 * Documentation rewrite. The doc is now in asciidoc format + new configuration examples
 * Autoconfiguration: We wait for all the channels in the PAT to be configured before continuing
 * Autoconfiguration: New option autoconf_scrambled which permit to autoconfigure scrambbled channels even without cam_support
 * CAM support: We look on the packets to check if the descrambling was successful
 * Option dont_send_scrambled to avoid sending scrambled packets (thus not making SAP announces for scrambled channels)
 * Option to show the traffic for each channel
 * Reduce CPU usage : experimental feature : DVB buffering
 * CAM : MuMuDVB can reset the CAM module if it initialize badly
 * SAP : new option sap_uri.
 * VLC bug : add an option to avoid sending the SDT, this is a workaround for VLC

Bugs corrected :
 * Cam support : wait a bit more between polling events (solve problems with T-Rex Supermodule v4.6)
 * Cam : Change the list managment. This solves the problem of only one channel descrambled with aston pro
 * We check if the PMT_QUERY sending (asking a channel to be descrambled) to the CAM was sucessful. 
 * Autoconfiguration, pat rewrite, CAM : we check the transport_stream id. This solve problems with shared PMT betwwen channels.

-- Mumudvb 1.5.4 --

New features / improvements : 
 * New stack for cam support, based on libdvben50221 from dvb_apps
 * Option dont_tune to avoid mumudvb to try to tune the card (can be used to test dvb-s2)
 * Non ascii channels names are now well handled by autoconf
 * Autoconfiguration : Better pid selection (new descriptor types added), can correct issues with some nondetected audio/video pids
 * Autoconfiguration ; Detection of the PCR PID, this solves problem with vlc and the absence of sound on certain channels
 * A configuration file is generated after autoconfiguration
 * Preliminary support for ATSC cards, new option atsc_modulation
	
Bugs corrected :
 * We don't set the filters multiple times
 * Better reading of the config file
 * Segmentation faults with some particular configuration files
 * Bug in intialisation scripts
 * Better handling of partial packets. Mumudvb doesn't exit anymore.
	
-- Mumudvb 1.5.3 --

New features : 
 * Option multicast_ttl to override default ttl
 * Option autoconf_ip_header, to change the first part of ip adresses used by autoconfiguration
 * Option sap_default_group
 * Init scripts, cf scripts/ directory
 * Smaller memory footprint
	
Bugs corrected : 
 * Better conformances to RFC for sap announces (this correct issues with VLC < 0.8.6f)
 * Better memory freeing
 * CRC32 calculation was wrong on 64bits platforms
	
-- Mumudvb 1.5.2 --

New features : 

 * Generation of sap announces (beta)

Bugs corrected : 
 * Segfault when the directory /var/run/mumudvb doesn't exist
 * Gcc 4.2 issues when using pat rewriting or autoconfiguration
 * Small corrections

-- Mumudvb 1.5 --

This is a test version for autoconf and cam support

New features : 

 * Support for conditionnal acces modules (support of scrambled channels) (beta)
 * Support for autoconfiguration. Mumudvb is now able to partially decode the stream to find the channels. (beta)

 * Verbosity levels for log messages
 * Better default values for DVB-T
 * common_port directive

Bugs corrected : 
 * Logging priority issue (LOG_INFO and co)
 * General code cleaning
 * Small bugs

Documentation update

-- Mumudvb 1.2 --

New Features : 
 * PAT revriting : For some set top boxes, the pid PAT (wich announces the channels) should only contain the streamed channel
   When you enable pat_revriting, mumudvb modify the pat packets for that

Bugs Corrected 
 * Small bugs

-- Mumudvb 1.0 --

First major release of mumudvb
